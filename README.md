# Warfare Simulator
## Game description
In this intense third-person shooter, players take control of a soldier trapped in a zombie-infested zone. To survive, they must navigate the map, collecting essential supplies while avoiding relentless zombie hordes. 
If the player gets too close, zombies will aggressively pursue them, creating a constant sense of danger. Armed with a weapon, the soldier can repel zombies by shooting them back. However, every shot comes at a costâ€”firing too many bullets gradually slows the player down, adding a strategic element to combat and resource management. 
Only by balancing firepower, mobility, and tactical movement can players successfully escape the deadly zone.
